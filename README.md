## Who am I?

Hi there! My name is Carlos. I am a Software Engineer originally from Llama Land (Peru 🇵🇪🦙) but I have been living in Kangaroo Land (Australia 🇦🇺🦘) since 2017.

My love language is Ruby. I am learning Elixir atm and I have some experience with Scala and Typescript.

I love singing and playing guitar. Feel free to use me as a jukebox if we ever cross paths. Here is my [songlist](https://songlist.rojas.au/). Song requests are welcomed!!

## How do I prefer to communicate?

Slack except for coffee chats, love a good sync 1 on 1 convo here and there!!

I like to use https://conventionalcomments.org/ for code reviews.

Love to use diagrams and (now virtual) whiteboarding whenever possible, you will probably see me drawing 🎨 at some point

## Things you should know about me

My favourite dish is the Peruvian version of the spaghetti bolognese 🍝. Different from the Italian recipe, it’s prepared with whole pieces of chicken and dried mushrooms.
